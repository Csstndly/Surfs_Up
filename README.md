# Surfs_Up
## Overview Analysis
### Purpose

The purpose of this analysis is to provide insight into the weather patterns of a specific location in Oahu where the client would like to build their shop. This analysis will compare two major months of two different seasons June and December. This comparison will help discover the patterns of temperatures and precipitation during vacation seasons to choose which areas to build a shop.

## Results
### Similarities and Differences

* Precipitation of 1 inch or greater in December (88in) is twice as much as June (39in) from the data going from 2010 through 2017. This could imply that December is Oahuâ€™s rainy season. 

* The average temperature for both months are relatively close 71 degrees for (Dec) and 75 degrees for (June). The temperature of Oahu is pretty constant with the standard deviations also not being too far apart. Concluding that the temperature rarely varies to far from the averages. 


## Summary
## Considerations
In all it seems like the location is a good spot to open a surf shop. However, there should be more data analyzed to see which location within the city that would be better and if the locations in the within Oahu are more popular or seen as better because of the weather, specifically during the rainy season.
